# ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION

Hello everybody,

After a few years I'm releasing a new skin, called Fireflies! The name says it all, the skins glow in the dark.

CTs are colored blue and Ts are colored red. Weapons are yellow/orange. C4 is colored pink. Any other items (grenades f.e.) are green.

**EDIT(v2 uploaded)**: Changed the *.vmt files and the skins are now working without "sv_pure" value "-1". Special Thanks to Devieus, for giving me good and useful feedback. :)

I'll appreciate for every comment, positive or negative. Telling me the reason and maybe a way to do it better would be nice!

**preview-video is in progress (every preview is welcome!)**

-greetings SHooDoX
